# TMT - Task Manager Tool (Java)

TMT is a lightweight and user-friendly Task Manager tool built with Java Swing. It provides a simple yet powerful interface for monitoring and managing running processes on your system.

## Features

- **Process Monitoring**: View detailed information about running processes, including PID, name, CPU usage, and memory usage.
- **Real-time Updates**: Although Java Swing does not support real-time updates like Tkinter, the application provides a refresh button to update the process list manually.
- **Cross-platform**: TMT works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, allowing you to use it on your preferred operating system.
